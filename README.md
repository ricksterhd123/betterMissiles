== Better missiles
The standard GTA:SA missile guidance / trajectory path is good but I 
decided I can try improve it slightly...

The best method I can find is 'proportional navigation' which is a 
guidance law used by homing/ target missiles IRL. I managed to 
implement a shabby version of that using previous implementations found 
online.
